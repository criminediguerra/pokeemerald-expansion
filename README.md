# Outfits System

## What is this?

This is a feature branch that implements _Outfits System_ into Pok√©mon Emerald, which also adds:
*  SDH's [commit](<https://github.com/ShinyDragonHunter/pokeemerald/commit/05f8f2688b22454e9d2400db1621375f1e4ccb3c>) for simplifying the player states system and thus making this system easier to implement. (Required)
* An item called _`OUTFIT BOX`_ for storing and changing the player's current outfit.
* A menu for changing outfits that is called in the OUTFIT BOX item. (Can also be configured to be called somewhere else if wanted)
* Several scripting macros for unlocking an outfit, checking the state of an outfit and buffers an outfit's name/description.

This is _not_ a faithful port of Gen 6's Outfits System. So, if you want it to behave similarly to Gen 6's system, you're likely gonna have to go on your own there. However, questions regarding the Outfits System is welcomed.

Note that this feature branch is still missing some of the features that's necessary, such as the ability to purchase outfits. So, stay tune for more until then!
